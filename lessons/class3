 General objects

Remember that most of the Ruby objects can be have like some primitive you want (String, Integer, Array, Hash)
Use to_s, to_i, to_a in objects you think it can behave like that.



Conditionals
Every ruby object behaves as true in a boolean context except nil and false.

Operators:
  &&: similar to and
  ||: similar to or
  not: similar to !
  <: less than
  >: greater than
  ==: eql to (use eql? instead)


Several ways to loop at Ruby

1. with for:

  for i in some_collection
    ...
  end
2. with while:

  while some_condition
    ...
  end
3. with times:

  10.times do |i|
    ...
  end
4. with each

  collection.each do |my_value|
    ...
  end
